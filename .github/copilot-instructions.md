- This workspace contains a React frontend (Vite, TypeScript) and a FastAPI backend (Python).
- The backend exposes endpoints for submitting potluck entries, fetching all entries, admin login, and Excel download.
- The frontend should use the backend API for all data operations.
- Use Docker and docker-compose for local development and deployment.
- The backend writes and serves an Excel file for admin download.
- The frontend should have a split layout: left for entry form, right for summary and admin actions.
